The No-Laser Cut Face Shield - PPE Face Shield - COVID-19 Response.

This is a No-Laser required face shield PPE design, it is NOT optimal, it is NOT approved by healthcare professionals, it isn't particularly EASY to make, but it offers an OPTION to those that have no access to a laser cutter. The only caveat is you will need to source a 0.5mm Polypropelyne sheet or strip that is an XY of at least 800x60mm.

To make the design feasible and repeatable, there are small 3D printed tools that aid in the build process, and help to get consistent and usable results. Be aware that while Polypropelyne is fairly straightforward to cut, you will need to be EXTREMELY careful to avoid any blade slip, both to safeguard yourself, and to ensure that the shield will work, and accept the visor.
