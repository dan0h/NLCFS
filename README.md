The No-Laser Cut Face Shield - PPE Face Shield - COVID-19 Response. This design is not to replace 3D printed versions, rather it is to empower people to make their own visors, I encourage the printing and distribution of these tools and instructions!

<B>LATEST 26/04/2020: STL and DXF's live. First draft of VERY rough instructions live. Waiting for Acetate to arrive so I can document the face shield part...</B>

This is a No-Laser required face shield PPE design, it is NOT optimal, it is NOT approved by healthcare professionals, it isn't particularly EASY to make, but it offers an OPTION to those that have no access to a laser cutter. The only caveat is you will need to source a 0.5mm Polypropelyne sheet or strip that is an XY of at least 800x60mm.

To make the design feasible and repeatable, there are small 3D printed tools that aid in the build process, and help to get consistent and usable results. Be aware that while Polypropelyne is fairly straightforward to cut, you will need to be EXTREMELY careful to avoid any blade slip, both to safeguard yourself, and to ensure that the shield will work, and accept the visor.

<B>3D PRINTER OWNERS:</B> If you have a 3D printer, please consider printing one of the many existing designs of PPE face shield (https://3dverkstan.se/protective-visor/) available. HOWEVER, my tooling set isn't simply one visor, rather it empowers people to make many visors by hand, using the tools as working guides, it may or may not be more efficient than 3D printing alone, but, if nothing else, people can be making visors by hand, while waiting for printers to print :)
